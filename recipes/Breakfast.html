    Skillet Pepper and Garlic Pork
</h1>
<p>
    Delicious! Very peppery, so you’ve gotta be a fan of pepper and like a kick. 
    The only change I made was to add some cracked salt to both sides of the pork during the browning phase. 
    Garlic lovers may also want to throw another clove or two in.

    This has a good base to work with, how ever I cut the cream cheese, 
    sour cream and soup in half, I added garlic and onion to the meat and salt 
    and pepper to taste. It turned out great, the cream cheese add a good flavor. 
    My 6yr old loved it, and it was quick and easy. Will use in the future.
