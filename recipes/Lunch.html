    The Ultimate Pool Sandwich
</h1>
<p>The ingredients are easy; you can make this sandwich from whatever deli meats and cheeses you have on hand. Kid hands can also help in the process. Simply make or buy a round unsliced bread loaf, cut off the top, scoop out the insides, and fill. The completed round sandwich stores well in the fridge overnight. Slice it ahead and put it in zip-top bags. Or, keep it in the circular form and wrap the entire sandwich for slicing and serving poolside.
